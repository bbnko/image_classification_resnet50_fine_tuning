<h1>Description
  
<h4>This code provides an example of fine-tuning a ResNet50 model on a dataset of different types of rice.

Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-image-dataset

<h1>Requirements
  
<h4>torch == 2.2.1+cu121 (Ensure that CUDA 12.1 is installed - can be downloaded from Nvidia's website. Torch installation instructions are available on their website: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
<h4>torchvision == 0.17.1+cu121
<h4>sklearn == 1.4.1.post1
<h4>numpy == 1.26.4
<h4>matplotlib == 3.8.3

<h1>Running the code
  
<h4>Execute cells one-by-one in the notebook.
<h4>Note: model training may take a considerable amount of time, depending on the hardware, expecially in case of CPU training.
